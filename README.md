I am planning to make a youtube turorial video about this software. See my channels page for the video - It should be named like this project is.   
My Channel URL is here:  
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3cOjFu-MLj8GGDkpeIhqhQ

The place where i usually store such kind of tutorial videos is here:  
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6npOHuBGrpBw4hKaalqa1E8tGNNf8KoO
  
If you fo not find a tutorial video inside this playlist, i advise you to keep on using the manual/readme at the github page or my website for help.
